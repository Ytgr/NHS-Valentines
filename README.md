Download files from GitHUB, typically by presssing the green "Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP" at the bottom.

Unzip the download, and navigate to the folder containing the files. 

Place a TSV (Tab Separated Values) file, containing the responses that need to be processed, into the folder. Make note of the name.

Run the program by double clicking the "ProcessResponses.exe" file. Enter the name (case sensitive, including file extension .tsv), and press enter. The program should process the responses, and place the results in the "Results" folder
Note: If the folder is placed in a OneDrive location, you may get a pop-up asking if you want to remove the old results files when you run the program after the first time. These should be removed.

Test it out using the provided "example.tsv" file that is packaged with the rest of the program (it is already in the correct folder).
